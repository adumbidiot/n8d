This is version 2 of the swfReader project. It can parse an an entire file sucessfully, but lacks modularity and extendability. It also is unable to understand most tags. A false start was prototype has been left in. 

While this project was abandoned, it proved to be an importannt stepping stone to futrue suceess; large portions of its codebase were adapted for v3 and i come here often to make sure v3 is working as expected. 

In short, what this lacks in completeness or neatness, it more than makes up for in reliability. Besides, this was the first true sucess of this project.
